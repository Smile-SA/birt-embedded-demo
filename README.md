birt-embedded-demo
==================

This project aims to create a sample library using BIRT, built with maven.

The idea is to have no hardcore path, only classpath references.

Right now, only basic reports are supported ... we are closer to a PDF generator =)

But with little work, it sure can be a great tool to build static report (without using the webviewer) !
